# PathPermutor
### Generate Contextual Directory Wordlist For Target Org 

This script generates contextual wordlist for any target org based on the set of URLs given.
You can feed it URLs from Gau, Wayback machine, Burp Proxy or any other place. This will generate combinations of paths that you can use in directory busting.




#### Usage:  python3 pathpermuter.py InputFile.txt OutputWordlist.txt

This is just a test version that has lot of bugs. I will improve it eventually :) 
In case you think more usecases can be added feel free to ping me on twitter @1337tr0lls :)
